# A-B-Testing-using-Python
This is a simple A/B Testing project using Python for Ad campaigns. 

I collected a dataset of 2 csv files (control_group.csv and test_group.csv) from Kaggle. The dataset contains 'Campaign Name', 'Date', Spend', 'No of Impressions', 'Reach', 'No of Website Clicks', 'No of Searches', 'No of View Content', 'No of Add to Cart', 'No of Purchase'.

A/B testing helps in finding a better approach to finding customers, marketing products, getting a higher reach, or anything that helps a business convert most of its target customers into actual customers.

Here I analyzed the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns. For example, when I started an ad campaign on Instagram to promote my Instagram post for the very first time, my target audience was different from the target audience of my second ad campaign. After analyzing the results of both ad campaigns, I always preferred the audience of the second ad campaign as it gave better reach and followers than the first one.
