# A-B-Testing-using-Python
This is a simple A/B Testing project using Python for Ad campaigns. 

I collected a dataset of 2 csv files (control_group.csv and test_group.csv) from Kaggle. The dataset contains 'Campaign Name', 'Date', Spend', 'No of Impressions', 'Reach', 'No of Website Clicks', 'No of Searches', 'No of View Content', 'No of Add to Cart', 'No of Purchase'.

A/B testing helps in finding a better approach to finding customers, marketing products, getting a higher reach, or anything that helps a business convert most of its target customers into actual customers.
